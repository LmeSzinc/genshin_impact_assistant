## Introduction

Auto Gathering Assist can automatically get most of the materials in Teyvat world, such as collectables, loot, etc.

Examples: Automatic collection of sweet flowers and glass lilies, automatic brushing of slimes and fools (requires high level of practice).

This function integrates automatic combat assistance, automatic movement assistance, and pickup assistance. Make sure to read the configuration information about them before using them.

Note: For the time being, only some items in the Mond area are supported. The scope will be gradually expanded in the future.

## Quick start

Set basic parameters in the GUI or in the settings/auto_collector.json file in the config folder.

Start automatic acquisition from the GUI interface.

## parameter settings

- Recommended to edit in GUI

| key | item |
|--------------|------------------|
| collection_name | The name of the item to be collected |
| collection_type | The type of collected items, divided into `COLLECTION` (general collection items) and `ENEMY` (combat drop items) |

## Collect logs

The collection log (collection_log.json) is a log file generated by automatic collection assistance, including:

| key | item |
|--------------|------------------|
| time | collection time |
| id | The id of the type of drop |
| error_code | exit reason |
| picked item | All items picked during this collection |

Error Code Meaning

| err_code | item |
|----|----|
|`IN_PICKUP_COLLECTOR_TIMEOUT`|Pickup timeout|
|`CHARACTER_DIED`|A character died|
|`ALL_CHARACTER_DIED`|All characters died|
|`PICKUP_TIMEOUT_001`|No more items to pick up|
|`PICKUP_TIMEOUT_002`|The item has not been successfully picked up within the specified time|
|`PICKUP_END_001`| Pickup ends normally ~~ (almost impossible~~|

## Collected locations

The collected location (collected.json) holds the id of the collected item.

Auto Gathering Assist automatically ignores these locations. Delete it to recover.

## Blacklist settings

These collection items can be blocked by adding ids to the list of corresponding items.

If the collection of some ids often fails, you can add them to the blacklist, and they will be automatically skipped in the next collection.
